each time builtin is called, a new output object is returned
should that be allowed or only one 'global' obj updated?
if allowed, how do i receive it? do i create a new object every time rb calls builtin?
is that even syntactically correct? would obj1 = obj2 copy the references, or something else? how should this be handled? how does it obj1 = obj2 even work?

same pathDir and homeDir need to be used across rb and builtins
might have to check resObj output since response was StringBuilder and resobj is string

fix exehandler and echo
