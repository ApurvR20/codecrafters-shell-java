each time builtin is called, a new output object is returned
should that be allowed or only one 'global' obj updated?
if allowed, how do i receive it? do i create a new object every time rb calls builtin?
is that even syntactically correct? would obj1 = obj2 copy the references, or something else? how should this be handled? how does it obj1 = obj2 even work?
